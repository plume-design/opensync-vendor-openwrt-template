# In current MTK driver, there is another parameter named "country region" used to control enable/disable of channels.
# The final valid channel list is the intersection of wireless_regdb(country code) and country region.
# For US 5G band, current default region is 9, which valid channel list is 36-64,100-116,132-140,149-165,
# this is why channel 120,124,128 are unavailable under US-FCC.
# For this to be working, we need to set the country region to 26ï¼Œwhich corresponds to channel list 36-64, 100-144, 149-177.
