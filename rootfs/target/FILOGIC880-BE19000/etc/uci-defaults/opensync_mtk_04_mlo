# This enables MLO on the ra*3 and ra*6 interfaces
# which are currently mapped for this device model
# to be WPA3-capable Fronthauls.
#
# Other interfaces are not pulled into MLD groups, and are
# kept as single-link MLOs, because:
#  - backhauls: IPs subnet clash risk, needs research
#  - aux: used for WPA2 compat
#
# Each group can be 1-16. 0 means "single-link MLD
# autogroup". Do not use 17+. Typically each column below
# should share a distinct number, or 0.
